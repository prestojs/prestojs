/**
 * Middleware to transform and cache a response
 *
 * The response is transformed & cached according to `viewModelMapping`.
 *
 * The simplest form of a mapping is to a Model:
 *
 * ```js
 * const middleware = [viewModelCachingMiddleware(User)];
 * const getUser = new Endpoint(new UrlPattern('/users/:id/'), { middleware });
 * ```
 *
 * If an element is a response is an array then it will transparently be treated as a list
 * of objects of the mapping type and the transformation function will be invoked for each
 * element one by one:
 *
 * ```js
 * const middleware = [viewModelCachingMiddleware(User)];
 * // Response is a single User instance:
 * const userRetrieve = new Endpoint(new UrlPattern('/users/:id/'), { middleware });
 * // Response is an array of User instances
 * // (declaration is the same but the response handler will treat it differently)
 * const userList = new Endpoint(new UrlPattern('/users/'), { middleware });
 * ```
 *
 * If the response is an object mapping different models you can specify how each
 * key is transformed. Each response value will be treated as an array/individual object
 * automatically:
 *
 * ```js
 * const middleware = viewModelCachingMiddleware({
 *     users: User,
 *     bookings: Booking,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Dot notation is also supported for nested objects (again each element may be a
 * single object or an array of objects)
 *
 * ```js
 * const middleware = viewModelCachingMiddleware({
 *     "records.users": User,
 *     "records.bookings": Booking,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The mapping can optionally be a function that returns a mapping or returns a promise that
 * resolves to a mapping. This is useful for dealing with dynamic imports or returning a class
 * that isn't yet defined.
 *
 * ```js
 * const middleware = paginationMiddleware(() => {
 *   const Booking = (await import('./Booking')).default;
 *   return {
 *     "records.users": User,
 *     "records.bookings": Booking,
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Each record instance created is also automatically added to the cache.
 *
 * Usually when deleting a model, the endpoint doesn't return anything. So by default if the endpoint method is DELETE
 * you should pass the model that will be deleted on a successful response.
 *
 * ```js
 * const middleware = [viewModelCachingMiddleware(User)];
 * // Response is empty:
 * const userDelete = new Endpoint(new UrlPattern('/users/:id/'), {
 *   middleware,
 *   method: "DELETE"
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Sometimes a deletion will cause a related model to change and you might want to return the modified model data.
 * In order to do this you specify model to be deleted as the `deleteViewModel` and the model(s) to be updated as the
 * `viewModelMapping`. Note that if you provide a `viewModelMapping` that isn't a single model without providing the
 * deleteViewModel option, you will get an error.
 *
 * ```js
 * const middleware = [viewModelCachingMiddleware({"records.bookings": Booking}, {deleteViewModel: User})];
 * // Response would include the updated related bookings, with the number of diners reduced by 1
 * const updatedBookings = new Endpoint(new UrlPattern('/users/:id/'), {
 *   middleware,
 *   method: "DELETE"
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * NOTE: If using with [paginationMiddleware](doc:paginationMiddleware) then this must come
 * before `paginationMiddleware`.
 *
 * @param viewModelMapping The mapping to use for caching as described above. When the request method is `DELETE` this
 * is assumed to be the model that should be removed from the cache unless you provide `options.deleteViewModel`. If
 * `deleteViewModel` is provided then this value is used to cache the response of the delete call.
 * @param options
 *
 * @extract-docs
 * @menu-group Middleware
