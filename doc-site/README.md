This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

The dev server is started when you run `yarn dev` in the root of the project.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Writing documentation

-   New pages can be created in \_pages as required
-   Documentation is auto generated from components with a comment tag `@extract-docs`. This is extracted with the `extract-docs.js` script.
    -   See `getStaticProps.js` for where this is processed including rendering of markdown
-   You can add specific overrides if necessary (see `viewModelFactory.js` for an example)
    -   You can reference generated docs via json file created by `extract-docs.js` - see `viewModelFactory.js` for example
-   Documentation can be written as a [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) file
    -   See `MDXProvider` in `Layout.js` for where this is controlled
        -   Note that there is also a `MDXProvider` used for autogenerated docs; this is setup in `getStaticProps.js`
-   Other comment tags you can use
    -   `@type-name MyOverride` - this replaces the type name with `MyOverride`. Useful when the typescript name is not suitable to display.
    -   `@expand-properties` - This expands each property of a type into it's own parameter on a function parameter table. If text is provided then the original name is also kept with a description matching this text. See `Form` for an example of this in use.
    
    
## Deployment

Currently deploying to netlify as now no longer lets you connect a personal account to an organization github account.

Deploys happen automatically on push.

We use the `next export` feature to generate a static build.
