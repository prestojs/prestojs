# View Model

In Presto a _ViewModel_ is a class that defines the list of
fields & some metadata for some piece of data (eg. a record from a single database table, some data joined from multiple
data sources, a form filled out by a user etc).

It's not specific to a backend implementation rather it's concerned with describing what the data is so that a UI can be
generated from it & transformations can be done on the data (eg. from user input to specific format or vice versa).

This package provides the core functionality for defining a [ViewModel](doc:viewModelFactory) and using them with a [ViewModelCache](doc:ViewModelCache).
