# @prestojs/ui

The `@prestojs/ui` package is concerned with providing high level components and a standard interface for customising form widgets
and field formatters throughout the system. It doesn't provide much in terms of concrete implementations for the UI. Using the interfaces
defined you can implement your own UI library or use a provided implementation (currently [@prestojs/ui-antd](/docs/ui-antd/) which
integrates with [antd](https://ant.design)).

At the top level is [UiProvider](doc:UiProvider) which allows you to define the various UI specific components to use throughout
the system. For example you can define the `formItemComponent` which is used by [@prestojs/final-form](/docs/final-form)
or `getWidgetForField` which is used by [FieldWidget](doc:FieldWidget) to render the widget for a specific field.

[FieldFormatter](doc:FieldFormatter) is used for rendering the _value_ of a field on a form. For example the [ChoiceFormatter](doc:ChoiceFormatter)
component renders the label for a selected choice field. This is generally used with a [ViewModel](doc:viewModelFactory) but
doesn't have to be. `@prestojs/ui` provides implementations for this formatters as they generally just involve formatting a string
or using standard HTML elements. To get the default implementation for a field see [getFormatterForField](doc:getFormatterForField).

[FieldWidget](doc:FieldWidget) is used for rendering the _input_ used to set the value in a form based on the type of a field.
For example a [DateField](doc:DateField) may render as a calendar input widget as implemented by [DateWidget](doc:DateWidget).
[FieldWidget](doc:FieldWidget) resolves the UI specific widget to use for a [Field](doc:Field). `@prestojs/ui` doesn't
currently provide a default implementation for these as they tend to be highly specific. `@prestojs/ui-antd` provides an implementation
for [antd](https://ant.design) or you can implement your own.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @prestojs/ui
```

Then you will need to add the [UiProvider](doc:UiProvider) at the top of your app. See [it's documentation](doc:UiProvider)
for an example of this.

## Formatters

A field formatter is just a component that accepts a `value` prop and renders it:

```js
function UpperCaseFormatter({ value }) {
    if (!value) {
        return value;
    }
    return value.toUpperCase();
}
```

When you use [FieldFormatter](doc:FieldFormatter) it just works out what formatter component to use based on what the
`getFormatterForField` function on your [UiProvider](doc:UiProvider) returns:

```jsx codesandbox=ui-provider-basic hidenavigation=1
```
