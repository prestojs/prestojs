# ViewModel & Caching

A lot of Presto is built around the concept of a _ViewModel_. In Presto a _ViewModel_ is a class that defines the list of
fields & some metadata for some piece of data (eg. a record from a single database table, some data joined from multiple
data sources, a form filled out by a user etc).

It's not specific to a backend implementation rather it's concerned with describing what the data is so that a UI can be
generated from it & transformations can be done on the data (eg. from user input to specific format or vice versa).

---

## Fields

A field is defined using the [Field](doc:Field) class:

```js
new Field({ name: 'email', label: 'Email' });
```

This tells us the field name is `email` and when a label is needed (eg. on a form field or when displaying the value)
`Email address` should be used. The first advantage of this is simply the DRY principle - you can render the `label`
from the field instead of hardcoding it throughout your app.

The second advantage is that it provides the basis for automatically generating UI for managing instances of the _ViewModel_
For example using the details provided on a _Field_ a form for entering those details can be rendered.

More specific field classes provide more details about how that field should be handled.

> See the [ViewModel](/docs/viewmodel) documentation for the list of available fields or the [Field](doc:Field) documentation
> for how to extend and implement your own.

```js
new IntegerField({ name: 'age', label: 'Age' });
```

The UI code now knows the field rendered should be treated as a numeric entry. More details can be specified:

```js {4-5}
new BooleanField({
    name: 'optInCommunications',
    label: 'Received Updates',
    helpText: 'Receive periodic updates from us',
    defaultValue: true,
});
```

UI components now know the default value when creating a record should be `true` and there's some additional text that
should be rendered around the field.

## ViewModel Factory

Fields are grouped together on class called a `ViewModel` that is created with the [viewModelFactory](doc:viewModelFactory)
function:

```js
const userFields = {
    name: new CharField(),
    emailAddress: new EmailField(),
};
const User = viewModelFactory(userFields);
```

We can omit the `name` and `label` options for the fields when defining them with a `viewModelFactory`. The name must
always match the object key it's defined against so can always be inferred. Label is inferred from the name - `emailAddress`
becomes `Email Address`.

`viewModelFactory` just returns a class so it can be extended and have extra properties or methods attached:

```js
class User extends viewModelFactory(userFields) {
    static label = 'User';
    static labelPlural = 'Users';
}
```

The static properties `label` and `labelPlural` are useful for referring to the name of a single or many instances of
a `ViewModel`.

In some cases it may be desirable to have a base class that contains some field definitions and extend that base class
with some new fields. This is possible using [augment](doc:viewModelFactory#method-augment):

```js
class StaffUser extends User.augment({ isSuperUser: new BooleanField() }) {
    static label = 'Staff User';
    static labelPlural = 'Staff';
}
```

`StaffUser` will inherited all the same fields as `User` and add a new field called `isSuperUser`.

We can create a record from a `ViewModel` class by instantiating it with it's data:

```js
const staffUser = new StaffUser({
    id: 1,
    name: 'Bob',
    email: 'bob@example.com',
    isSuperUser: true,
});
```

The `id` field hasn't been mentioned thus far but must be present on all records to uniquely identify it. You can specify
your own primary key field (or fields for compound keys) but by default a field called `id` is created. See [viewModelFactory](doc:viewModelFactory#method-viewmodel)
documentation for details on customising the primary key name.

You can always access the primary key for a record using the `_key` property regardless of what the underlying field(s)
are.

```js
staffUser._key === 1;
// true
```

Sometimes you only have _some_ of the fields on the record. Presto supports the concept of a _partial record_ which is
simply a record with a subset of the fields filled in. To create a partial record simply instantiate the record with
only the fields you have available. This concept becomes important when we start to deal with caching.

> **NOTE**
>
> A partial record is not the same as a record with null values. A partial record has _no_ value for some fields whereas
> a regular record may just have some values set to null.

Fields can be accessed via the [fields](docs:ViewModel#var-fields) property or [getField](docs:ViewModel#method-getField)
property. [getField](docs:ViewModel#method-getField) supports traversing related ViewModel fields which will be discussed
later.

## Related ViewModel's

One _ViewModel_ often refers to another (eg. a foreign key from one table to another in a database). To model this use
[RelatedViewModelField](doc:RelatedViewModelField).

```js {3-4}
class PhoneNumber extends viewModelFactory({
    phoneNumber: new CharField(),
    userId: new IntegerField(),
    user: new RelatedViewModelField({ to: User, sourceFieldName: 'userId' }),
}) {}
```

There's two fields required: the field that stores the actual ID of the related record and a field to store a link to
actual related record itself.

The `to` option can either be a `ViewModel` class directly, a function that returns a `ViewModel` class or a function
that returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `ViewModel` class. The second form is useful when the class hasn't been
defined yet and the `Promise` form can be used to dynamically import code. See [RelatedViewModelField](doc:RelatedViewModelField)
for how that works.

As mentioned above `getField` can be used to traverse related ViewModel fields. This is done using array notation where
each entry in the array is a field name (all entries apart from the last must be a [RelatedViewModelField](doc:RelatedViewModelField)).

```js
PhoneNumber.getField(['user', 'email']);
```

This will return the `email` field from the `User` ViewModel.

Circular references are also supported using the function form for `to`:

```js {4-8}
class User extends viewModelFactory({
    name: new CharField(),
    emailAddress: new EmailField(),
    defaultPhoneNumberId: new IntegerField(),
    defaultPhoneNumber: new RelatedViewModelField({
        to: () => PhoneNumber,
        sourceFieldName: 'defaultPhoneNumberId',
    }),
}) {}
class PhoneNumber extends viewModelFactory({
    phoneNumber: new CharField(),
    userId: new IntegerField(),
    user: new RelatedViewModelField({ to: User, sourceFieldName: 'userId' }),
}) {}
```

Although somewhat useless in this case you can retrieve fields across the relations:

```js
User.getField(['defaultPhoneNumber', 'user', 'defaultPhoneNumber', 'phoneNumber']);
```

Relations become really useful when used in conjunction with caching.

## ViewModel Caching

Each `ViewModel` class has an associated cache that is created automatically. You can provide your own by extending
[ViewModelCache](doc:ViewModelCache) and assigning it to the static `cache` property on the `ViewModel` class.

To cache an entry call the `add` method with either an instance of the record or the data directly:

```js
// These two statements are equivalent
User.cache.add(new User({ id: 1, name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' });
User.cache.add({ id: 1, name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com'  });
```

If you have nested data you can populate multiple caches based on defined [RelatedViewModelField](doc:RelatedViewModelField)
fields:

```js
User.cache.add({
    id: 1,
    name: 'John',
    email: 'john@example.com',
    phoneNumber: { id: 5, phoneNumber: '(03) 5550 1234', userId: 1 },
});
```

This will populate the `User` cache and `PhoneNumber` cache.

To get an entry use [get](ViewModelCache#method-get) or [getList](ViewModelCache#method-getList) methods using the primary key of the record and the list of fields you want:

```js
const john = User.cache.get(1, ['name']);
// User({
//   id: 1,
//   name: 'John',
// })
```

This will return a _partial record_ that contains only the `name` field. Accessing any other field will result in a
warning telling you the data was not available. Partial records are always kept in sync with the latest data where
possible (ie. when new data is cached that is a _superset_ of the fields on the partial record).

You can also retrieve the latest version of a record by passing a record instance:

```js
const latestJohn = User.cache.get(john);
```

> **NOTE**
>
> The primary key is _always_ returned regardless of whether you request it or not. If you request a `RelatedViewModelField`
> then the associated `sourceFieldName` is also returned regardless of whether you request it.

[getList](ViewModelCache#method-getList) can be used to retrieve multiple records. The options are the same as `get` except
you pass an array instead of a single id or record:

```js
const people = User.cache.getList([1, 2, 3], ['name']);
```

or with records

```js
User.cache.getList([frodo, samwise]);
```

Any records missing will be null by default but they can be removed by passing the final argument `removeNulls` which,
when `true`, will filter out any missing records.

You can also retrieve data across caches by using array notation for fields:

```js
User.cache.get(1, ['name', ['phoneNumber', 'phone']]);
// User({
//   id: 1,
//   name: 'John',
//   phoneNumber: PhoneNumber({
//     id: 5,
//     phoneNumber: '(03) 5550 1234',
//   })
// })
```

> **NOTE**
>
> Cache `get` and `getList` always return instances of a `ViewModel` even if the data is cached directly. `RelatedViewModelField`'s
> retrieved are also instances of the relevant `ViewModel` class.

To get notified when something in the case changes use [addListener](doc:ViewModelCache#method-addListener) or
[addListenerList](doc:ViewModelCache#method-addListenerList). To listen to any change just pass a function:

```js
cache.addListener(() => console.log('Change detected!'));
```

It will be called when anything at all changes in the cache.

To listen to specific record changes pass the ID and field names:

```js
User.cache.addListener(1, ['name'], (prev, current) => {
    console.log('Record changed from', prev, 'to', current);
});
```

or to multiple values:

```js
User.cache.addListenerList([1, 2, 3, 4], ['name'], (prev, current) => {
    console.log('Records changed from', prev, 'to', current);
});
```

## useViewModelCache

[useViewModelCache](doc:useViewModelCache) returns data from the cache and automatically re-renders whenever the
underlying data in the cache changes. With this you can write UI that responds immediately to changes to the cached
data it renders:

```js
const user = useViewModelCache(User, cache => cache.get(1, ['name', 'email']));
```

The second argument is just a selector function that gets passed the cache and can return any value. The selector will be called
anytime the cache changes and will re-render your component if the value returned from the selector differs from the last
time it was called.

The selector can return anything. Here we return user records grouped by a field:

```js
const usersByGroup = cache =>
    cache.getAll(['groupId', 'firstName', 'email']).reduce((acc, record) => {
        acc[record.groupId] = acc[record.firstName] || [];
        acc[record.groupId].push(record);
        return acc;
    }, {});
const groupedUsers = useViewModelCache(User, usersByGroup);
```

By default `useViewModelCache` will compare the previous and current value from the selector function using a strict
equality check. In the example above `usersByGroup` returns a new object each time and so will fail the equality check.
In critical parts of you application this may have a performance impact so for those times you can provide your own
equality check:

```js
import { isDeepEqual } from '@prestojs/util';

const groupedUsers = useViewModelCache(User, usersByGroup, [], isDeepEqual);
```

Here it uses the [isDeepEqual](doc:isDeepEqual) function to do a deep equality to avoid re-rendering when the data is
identical.

The third argument is a list of arguments to pass to the selector function. This allows you to write re-usable selectors
that can just be passed straight through to `useViewModelCache` that will only be called whenever any of the arguments
change.

```js
// Define a selector that selects a record from a cache
const selectRecord = (cache, id, fieldNames) => cache.get(id, fieldNames);

const fieldNames = ['name', 'id'];
const id = 1;

// selectRecord will be called only if id or fieldNames changes
const record = useViewModelCache(User, selectRecord, [id, fieldNames]);

// Alternatively you can use an arrow function. The difference is that
// selectRecord will be called every time the containing component or
// hook renders.
const record = useViewModelCache(user, cache => selectRecord(cache, id, fieldNames));
```
