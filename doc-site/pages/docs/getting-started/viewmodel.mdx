# ViewModel & Caching

The `@prestojs/viewmodel` package is a fundamental part of the Presto library. It's core concept is the ViewModel.
The ViewModel is a class that outlines the field types and associated metadata for a set of data.

The goal of ViewModel is to abstract data representation from its source or backend implementation. It allows for automatic
UI generation and advanced caching.

## Field Classes

Presto provides a base `Field` class for describing data fields:

```typescript
new Field({ label: 'Email' });
```

However, it's common to use more specific field classes to reflect data types:

```typescript
new IntegerField({ label: 'Age' });
```

If you don't specify `label` in the field options, it will be inferred from the field name.

Using specific field types allows the UI to tailor its input methods accordingly. For instance, an [IntegerField](doc:IntegerField) could generate a numeric
input on a form and apply locale-specific formatting on a detail view. More metadata can be specified:

```typescript
new BooleanField({
    label: 'Received Updates',
    helpText: 'Receive periodic updates from us',
    defaultValue: true,
});
```

This metadata can be used to generate UI elements automatically. For example, a form could be generated with a checkbox with
the specified label and add some help text underneath it.

> ViewModel concerns itself with defining ViewModel's and caching. Actual UI generation is handled
> with components from [@prestojs/antd](/docs/ui-antd/) and [@prestojs/antd](/docs/ui/), or your own custom components.

See the base [Field](doc:Field) documentation for the generic options available on all fields.

<Alert type="info">
    You can find the list of provided fields in the [ViewModel](/docs/viewmodel/) documentation under 'Fields' in the sidemenu.

    You can create your own custom fields. See [Creating custom
    fields](doc:Fields#Creating-custom-fields) for more information.

</Alert>

## ViewModel Factory Function

To create a ViewModel, Presto offers a factory function where you define the fields and options, like the primary key for the model.

```typescript
const fields = {
    userId: new IntegerField({ label: 'User ID' }),
    firstName: new CharField({ label: 'First Name' }),
    lastName: new CharField(),
};

const options = {
    pkFieldName: 'userId',
};

class User extends viewModelFactory(fields, options) {
    static cache = new MyCustomCache();
    static label = 'User';
    static labelPlural = 'Users';
}
```

In the above example, `User` class is created by extending the result of the [viewModelFactory](doc:viewModelFactory)
function with defined fields and options. The `fields` dictionary contains instances of field types, representing the
structure of the data. The options object must contain `pkFieldName` specifying the primary key field.

### ViewModel Options

-   `pkFieldName` - (required) Specifies the primary key field(s). Accepts a string or an array of strings for compound keys.

```typescript
// Single primary key
pkFieldName: 'userId',

// Compound key
pkFieldName: ['organisationId', 'departmentId'],
```

-   `baseClass` - (optional) Specifies a base class for the model. Automatically set to the class being augmented when using augment.

### ViewModel Properties

-   `cache` - (optional) Defines the cache to be used. By default, Presto provides a suitable cache, but it can be replaced with a custom one if needed.
-   `label` - (optional) Describes a single instance of the model. This can be used for generating UI elements, for example the title of a detail view.
-   `labelPlural` - (optional) Describes multipl instance of the model. This can be used for generating UI elements, for example the title of a list view.

See the [BaseViewModel](doc:BaseViewModel) class for all the available properties.

## Augmenting

Augmenting in is a way to extend your existing models while keeping the integrity of the original
class intact. This includes merging the fields from both classes so that properties like `fieldNames` reflect all fields.
The process also ensures that caching works seamlessly between the base class and the augmented one.

A significant use case of augmenting is code generation for creating base classes that reflect backend structures
(like Django models). You can then add frontend customizations to these base classes using augmenting.

### Augment Method

The `augment` method is called on an existing model and takes two arguments: `newFields` and `newOptions`.

```typescript
User.augment(newFields, newOptions);
```

The `newFields` argument is similar to the `fields` object passed to the `viewModelFactory` function. It contains a
dictionary of new field definitions you want to add or overwrite in the base model.

To remove a field from the base model in the augmented version, you can pass `null` as the field's value:

```typescript
newFields = {
    email: null, // Removes 'email' field from base model
    age: new IntegerField({ label: 'Age' }), // Adds or overwrites 'age' field
};
```

The `newOptions` argument is an optional parameter that takes an object similar to the options object in `viewModelFactory`.

If not provided, `newOptions` defaults to using the `pkFieldName` defined on the root model.

> NOTE: While `newOptions` is optional, it's recommended to always provide it with an explicit `pkFieldName` to avoid
> issues with typescript types.

### Code Generation and Base Class Customization

One of the significant benefits of augmenting is the ease it brings to code generation, especially when your base class
reflects a backend model (e.g., Django).

You can use a code generator to create the base classes based on your backend models. Afterward, augment these base
classes to tailor them to your frontend needs:

```typescript
// Codegen creates this in `BaseUser.ts` and will overwrite it whenever changes are made to the backend model
class BaseUser extends viewModelFactory(backendFields, backendOptions) {}

// You customize it in `User.ts`
class User extends BaseUser.augment(customFields, customOptions) {}
```

This pattern keeps your code DRY and ensures consistency between your backend and frontend structures while allowing for
frontend-specific customizations.

> Codegen like this could have many sources. The most obvious is database records directly, but often it's better
> to target the interface that's exposed by the backend API. For example, in django the records might be serialised
> using [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/). Having the frontend records match the serializer
> rather than the model makes more sense.
>
> Rather than thinking of `ViewModel` as corresponding to a database model, think of it as a representation of any typed data.

## Modeling Relationships

In `@prestojs/viewmodel`, you can define relationships between different models using the [RelatedViewModelField](doc:RelatedViewModelField)
or [ManyRelatedViewModelField](doc:ManyRelatedViewModelField). These fields provide a seamless way to map and manage relations
between different data models in your application.

### Single Related ViewModel

A single relation between two models can be established using the [RelatedViewModelField](doc:RelatedViewModelField). This
is suitable for one-to-one or many-to-one relationships.

For instance, suppose we have a `User` model and a ` PhoneNumber` model, where each `PhoneNumber` instance is related to a`User`:

```typescript
class PhoneNumber extends viewModelFactory(
    {
        id: new IntegerField(),
        phoneNumber: new CharField(),
        userId: new IntegerField(),
        user: new RelatedViewModelField({ to: User, sourceFieldName: 'userId' }),
    },
    { pkFieldName: 'id' }
) {}
```

In this example, user is a `RelatedViewModelField` that points to a `User` instance. The `sourceFieldName` parameter is
set to 'userId', indicating that `userId` could be used to lookup the instance of `User`. The `sourceFieldName` is always required.
This will be particularly important when working with caching, discussed later.

### Handling Circular References

Circular references are supported by passing a function that returns a ViewModel to `to`. This comes in handy when two
models need to reference each other:

```typescript
class User extends viewModelFactory(
    {
        id: new IntegerField(),
        name: new CharField(),
        emailAddress: new EmailField(),
        defaultPhoneNumberId: new IntegerField(),
        defaultPhoneNumber: new RelatedViewModelField({
            to: () => PhoneNumber,
            sourceFieldName: 'defaultPhoneNumberId',
        }),
    },
    { pkFieldName: 'id' }
) {}

class PhoneNumber extends viewModelFactory(
    {
        id: new IntegerField(),
        phoneNumber: new CharField(),
        userId: new IntegerField(),
        user: new RelatedViewModelField({ to: User, sourceFieldName: 'userId' }),
    },
    { pkFieldName: 'id' }
) {}
```

> Promises are supported in `to` as well. This is useful for lazy loading imports, however is considered an advanced
> use case. See the [RelatedViewModelField](doc:RelatedViewModelField) docs for examples.

### Many-to-many relationships

If a model is related to many instances of another model, you can represent this using the [ManyRelatedViewModelField](doc:ManyRelatedViewModelField).
This is suitable for many-to-many relationships, or the reverse of a `RelatedViewModelField`.

The `sourceFieldName` for `ManyRelatedViewModelField` should reference a [ListField](doc:ListField) that contains all the
related instance IDs:

```typescript
userIds: new ListField({
    childField: new IntegerField({}),
}),
users: new ManyRelatedViewModelField({ to: User, sourceFieldName: 'userIds' }),
```

## Working with ViewModel Instances

You can create an instance by instantiating ViewModel class with an object that provides the field values. The primary
key is always required, but all other fields are optional:

```typescript
const user = new User({ id: 1, name: 'Dave' });
```

### Partial Models

Partial models are instances where not all fields are specified. If a value isn't supplied for a field, the instance is
considered "partial" for that field. Note that a field with a `null` value is not considered partial - it's only partial
if no value is supplied at all.

To inspect which fields are specified in an instance, you can check the `_assignedFields` property:

```typescript
console.log(user._assignedFields); // Output: ['id', 'name']
```

### Accessing Field Values

Once a ViewModel instance is initialized, the fields it was initialized with can be accessed by their names:

```typescript
console.log(user.name); // Output: 'Dave'
```

The primary key value is available on it's name (e.g. `id`) but can also be accessed generically on the `_key` property.
This is useful when writing generic components that accept a ViewModel instance and need access to the primary key.

To access the `Field` instances themselves, you need to go via `ViewModel.getField`, e.g., `User.getField('name')`. From
a model instance, you can get its `ViewModel` class using `_model`:

```typescript
console.log(user._model === User); // Output: true
```

### Accessing Uninitialized Fields

Attempting to access a field that the instance was not initialized with will result in an error:

```typescript
console.log(user.emailAddress);
// Throws Error: 'emailAddress' accessed on User but was not instantiated with it. Available fields are: ...
```

### The \_f Property

The [\_f](doc:BaseViewModel#Property-_f) property, short for fields, holds 'Bound' instances of `Field` with a `value` property. For example, `user._f.name` would
return an instance of `CharField`, and `user._f.name.value` would return 'Dave':

```typescript
console.log(user._f.name); // Output: CharField instance
console.log(user._f.name.value); // Output: 'Dave'
```

The `_f` property is useful when you want to pass a field and its value around as a single entity, without having to separate them.

For example, [FieldFormatter](doc:FieldFormatter) supports passing a bound field rather than an unbound field and value.

### Including Related Records

Related records can be included when creating an instance:

```typescript
const user = new User({
    id: 1,
    name: 'Dave',
    defaultPhoneNumber: new PhoneNumber({ id: 2, phoneNumber: '999999' }),
});
```

In this case, `user.defaultPhoneNumberId` will be automatically set to match `user.defaultPhoneNumber.id`.

To see the fields in nested records, you can inspect `_assignedFieldsDeep`:

```typescript
console.log(user._assignedFieldsDeep);
// Output: [["defaultPhoneNumber","id"],["defaultPhoneNumber","phoneNumber"],"defaultPhoneNumberId","id","name"]
```

## ViewModel Caching

ViewModel caching is a core feature designed to manage and track changes in your data across
components, making your applications more responsive and efficient. By caching your data, you can listen to changes and
update your components in real-time as your data changes. This can make managing the flow of data easier by having a
single source of truth.

### Benefits of Caching

-   **Component Rerendering**: Whenever your data changes, your components are automatically rerendered. For instance, when
    a user record is updated, any component displaying this user's information is refreshed instantly.
-   **Cross-Component Updates**: Changes in one component can affect the data displayed in another. For instance, if one
    component creates a new user record, any other component displaying user information is updated to include the new user.
-   **Real-time Updates**: Real-time updates from other users are made easier through caching. If you use websockets for
    real-time data communication, updating the cache could be as simple as having the websocket listener write to the cache.

### How Caching Works

Caching is based on the primary key, and the fields that are specified when creating an instance. For example, the
following two instances are cached separately:

```typescript
const user1 = User.cache.add({ id: 1, name: 'John' });
const user2 = User.cache.add({ id: 1, email: 'john@example.com' });
```

When you read from the cache you specify the fields (or `"*"` for all fields):

```typescript
User.cache.get(1, ['name']);
// { id: 1, name: 'John' }
User.cache.get(1, ['email']);
//  id: 1, email: 'john@example.com'
User.cache.get(1, '*');
// null; cache miss because there's no cached record with all fields
User.cache.add({ id: 1, name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' });
const john = User.cache.get(1, '*');
//  id: 1, name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com'
```

You can also pass an instance of the ViewModel to get the latest version from the cache:

```js
const latest = User.cache.get(john);
// If there's been no changes to the record, the same instance is returned. Otherwise the
// latest version will be returned.
latest === john;
```

An update to a superset of fields will update all cached subsets:

```typescript
User.cache.add({
    id: 1,
    name: 'Johnny Smith',
    email: 'johnny@test.com',
});
console.log(User.cache.get(1, ['id', 'name']));
// { id: 1, name: 'Johnny Smith' }
console.log(User.cache.get(1, ['id', 'email']));
// { id: 1, email: 'johnny@test.com' }
```

The motivation for this behaviour is that it's more desirable for have records be internally consistent than to have each individual
field reflect the latest value. Having partial records is useful for restricting the amount of data that is sent to the
frontend.

> You don't have to use partial records everywhere. In many cases you can include all fields in the cache and things
> will generally be simpler. However, if you have a large number of fields, or you have a lot of records, you may want
> to embrace using partial records to reduce the amount of data fetched.

Note that if you request fields that aren't in the cache you will get no result (a cache miss). The primary key is
always included, so it is optional to include it in the list of fields.

### Using ViewModel Cache

Each `ViewModel` comes with a cache property, an instance of `ViewModelCache`. Here are some examples of how you can use the cache:

#### Adding a record

```typescript
User.cache.add(new User({ id: 1, name: 'John' }));
// Passing an instance is optional, you can just pass the data directly.
// An instance of the ViewModel is always returned.
const user = User.cache.add({ id: 1, name: 'John' });
```

#### Retrieving a record

When you retrieve a record you specify which fields you care about:

```typescript
const record = User.cache.get(1, ['id', 'name']);
```

Or use `"*"` to get all fields.

```typescript
const record = User.cache.get(1, '*');
```

#### Updating a record

This is the same as adding a record. If it already exists in the cache, it will be updated.

```typescript
User.cache.add({ id: 1, name: 'Johnny' });
```

#### Supersets and Subsets (Partial Records)

The cache is managed per unique set of fields, but a superset will update a subset

```typescript
User.cache.add({
    id: 1,
    name: 'Johnny Smith',
    email: 'johnny@test.com',
});
console.log(User.cache.get(1, ['id', 'name']));
// { id: 1, name: 'Johnny Smith' }
console.log(User.cache.get(1, ['id', 'name', 'email']));
// { id: 1, name: 'Johnny Smith', email: 'johnny@test.com' }
```

Updating just the `name` will leave the other instance in a consistent state:

```typescript
User.cache.add({
    id: 1,
    name: 'Jon',
});
console.log(User.cache.get(1, ['id', 'name']));
// { id: 1, name: 'Jon' }
// This instance remains unchanged
console.log(User.cache.get(1, ['id', 'name', 'email']));
// { id: 1, name: 'Johnny Smith', email: 'johnny@test.com' }
```

#### Deleting from Cache

You can delete specific caches for a subset of fields, or all fields:

```typescript
User.cache.delete(1, ['id', 'name']);
console.log(User.cache.get(1, ['id', 'name']));
// null

User.cache.delete(1);
console.log(User.cache.get(1, ['id', 'name', 'email']));
// null
```

#### Adding or Updating Multiple Records

This works the same as for a single record, but you pass an array instead:

```typescript
User.cache.addList([johnny, sam]);
```

#### Listing to changes

You can listen to changes for a single or multiple records:

```typescript
User.cache.addListener(2, ['id', 'name'], (previous, next) =>
    console.log(previous, 'change to', next)
);

User.cache.addListenerList([3, 4], ['id', 'name'], (previous, next) =>
    console.log(previous, 'change to', next)
);
```

### Caching & Related Fields

Fetching related fields is a common use case. For example, here we have a `User` that belongs to multiple `Group` records:

```typescript
class Group extends viewModelFactory(
    {
        id: new IntegerField(),
        name: new CharField(),
    },
    { pkFieldName: 'id' }
) {}

class User extends viewModelFactory(
    {
        id: new IntegerField(),
        name: new CharField(),
        groupIds: new ListField({ childField: new IntegerField() }),
        groups: new ManyRelatedViewModelField({
            to: Group,
            sourceFieldName: 'groupIds',
        }),
    },
    { pkFieldName: 'id' }
) {}
```

Related records can be added by nesting data and the corresponding caches will be updated:

```typescript
const user = User.cache.add({
    id: 1,
    name: 'Dave',
    groups: [{ id: 1, name: 'Tech Support' }],
});
```

This adds an entry into `User` and another entry into `Group` for the "Tech Support" group:

```typescript
console.log(Group.cache.get(4, ['name']));
Output: { id: 1, name: "Tech Support" }
```

Fetching the related fields reads all data from the relevant caches. Here the groups are read from the `Group` cache:

```typescript
User.cache.get(1, ['name', 'groups']);
// Output:
// {
//   groupIds: [
//     1,
//     4
//   ],
//   id: 1,
//   name: Dave,
//   groups: [
//     {
//       id: 1,
//       name: Admins
//     },
//     {
//       id: 4,
//       name: Tech Support
//     }
//   ]
// }
```

Any changes made to the group via the `Group` cache will be reflected in the `User` record fetched from the `User` cache.

### Using useViewModelCache React Hook

The [useViewModelCache](useViewModelCache) React hook provides an easy way to interact with
your ViewModel cache. This hook triggers a re-render of your component whenever the associated cache data changes, ensuring
your component always displays the most recent data.

#### Basic Usage

The `useViewModelCache` hook takes a `ViewModel` class as the first argument and a selector function as the second argument.
The selector function return the data you want from the cache.

```typescript
const user = useViewModelCache(User, cache => cache.get(1, ['name', 'email']));
```

Each time the cache changes, the selector function will be called. If the returned value differs from its previous result,
your component will re-render.

### Advanced Usage

The selector function can return any type of data. For instance, you could return user records grouped by a field:

```typescript
const usersByGroup = cache =>
    cache.getAll(['groupId', 'firstName', 'email']).reduce((acc, record) => {
        acc[record.groupId] = acc[record.firstName] || [];
        acc[record.groupId].push(record);
        return acc;
    }, {});
const groupedUsers = useViewModelCache(User, usersByGroup);
```

By default, `useViewModelCache` performs a strict equality check to compare the previous and current return values of
the selector function. However, for complex objects that are recreated every time the selector function runs, such as
in the example above, this can lead to unnecessary re-renders. To prevent this, you can provide your own equality function:

```typescript
import { isDeepEqual } from '@prestojs/util';

const groupedUsers = useViewModelCache(User, usersByGroup, [], isDeepEqual);
```

In this example, `isDeepEqual` is used to perform a deep equality check, avoiding re-renders when the data is identical.

#### Using Selector Arguments

The third argument of `useViewModelCache` is an array of arguments that will be passed to the selector function. This
feature allows you to create reusable selectors:

```typescript
// Define a selector outside the component that selects a record from a cache
const selectRecord = (cache, id, fieldNames) => cache.get(id, fieldNames);

const fieldNames = ['name', 'id'];
const id = 1;

// selectRecord will be called only if id or fieldNames changes
const record = useViewModelCache(User, selectRecord, [id, fieldNames]);
```

Alternatively, you can use an inline function. However, this means the `selectRecord` function will be called every time
the containing component or hook renders:

```typescript
const record = useViewModelCache(user, cache => selectRecord(cache, id, fieldNames));
```

#### Selector conventions

Selectors can be stored anywhere, but one common approach is to store them on the ViewModel class itself under a
`selectors` static property:

```typescript
class User extends BaseUser {
    static selectors = {
        getById: (cache, id, fieldNames) => cache.get(id, fieldNames),
    };
}
```

You can then re-use it throughout your application:

```typescript
useViewModelCache(User, User.selectors.getById, [1, ['name', 'email']]);
```

This is just a recommended convention - nothing in Presto relies on this structure.
