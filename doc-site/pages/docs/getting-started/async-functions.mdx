# Async Hooks

Presto provides 3 hooks for dealing with asynchronous calls such as API calls.

## useAsync

The [useAsync](doc:useAsync) is a low level hook to deal with triggering async function calls and handling response / errors and loading states.

```jsx
async function getUser(id) {
    // Does API call to fetch user
}
const { response, isLoading, error, run, reset } = useAsync(getUser, {
    args: [userId],
});
```

[useAsync](doc:useAsync) will go through the following steps:

-   When `run` is called `isLoading` will become true
-   Once the function `getUser` resolves `isLoading` will become false
-   If `getUser` promise rejects `error` will be set to the rejected value
-   If `getUser` promise resolves `response` will be set to the resolved value

By default you have to call `run` to make the function execute but often you
want it to happen automatically on mount and then again when anything changes.

We can make it do that by setting the trigger:

```jsx {2}
const { response, isLoading, error, run, reset } = useAsync(getUser, {
    trigger: 'SHALLOW',
    args: [userId],
});
```

The trigger tells `useAsync` when to run the function. By default it is `MANUAL` which
means only you explicitly call `run` but it call also be `DEEP` or `SHALLOW`: these two values
refer to the method by which the previous and current arguments are compared. With `DEEP` it
does a deep object comparison and with `SHALLOW` a shallow comparison (ie. one level deep).

Now when the component is first rendered `getUser` will be called. When `userId` changes it will
be called again.

What if we don't have `userId` yet and want to only call `getUser` once we do? For cases like
this dynamically changing the `trigger` is the easiest solution:

```jsx {2}
const { response, isLoading, error, run, reset } = useAsync(getUser, {
    trigger: userId != null ? 'SHALLOW' : 'MANUAL',
    args: [userId],
});
```

Until we have `userId` the trigger will be set to `MANUAL` and nothing will be called (unless
we manually call `run`).

The `reset` function can be called to clear `error` and `response`.

## useAsyncListing

[useAsyncListing](doc:useAsyncListing) is more specialised and works with lists of data and assists with handling
pagination.

```jsx
async function getUsers({ query }) {
    // Call an API endpoint with the specified `query` parameters
}
const { result, isLoading, error } = useAsyncListing({
    trigger: 'SHALLOW',
    execute: getUsers,
    query: { keywords },
});
```

This works similar to `useAsync` but supports a few additional options and expects the function
to return an `Array`. In the example above the function `getUsers` will be called and passed
the `query` object (eg. so it can return results filtered by the supplied keywords).

If the response is paginated a [Paginator](doc:Paginator) instance can be provided to handle the
pagination state. A Paginator abstracts away how the pagination is stored, how it's updated from
a response and how the state is changed (eg. going to the next page).

Some paginators like [PageNumberPaginator](doc:PageNumberPaginator) are provided.

```jsx {10,12,16}
async function getUsers({ query, paginator }) {
    // Call an API endpoint with the specified `query` parameters
    const requestInit = paginator.getRequestInit({ query });
    const response = await fetch('/users', requestInit).then(r => {
        if (r.ok) {
            return r.json();
        }
        throw r;
    });
    paginator.setResponse({ total: response.count, response.pageSize });
}
const paginator = usePaginator(PageNumberPaginator);
const { result, isLoading, error } = useAsyncListing({
    trigger: 'SHALLOW',
    execute: getUsers,
    paginator,
    query: { keywords },
});
```

The first highlighted row shows how the pagination state is updated from the backend: specifically
it is told the total number of records & the size of each page.

The second highlighted row shows usage of [usePaginator](doc:usePaginator) to create a paginator
instance that is hooked up to some local state. The local state is where the pagination state is
stored so that we can re-render React components whenever it changes.

The third highlighted row shows how you pass it to `useAsyncListing`.

To then change page call the relevant functions on the paginator:

```jsx
<button onClick={() => paginator.next()}>Next Page</button>
```

When the button is pressed `paginator.next()` will be called which will update
the pagination state which will trigger a new call to `useAsyncListing`.

[useAsyncListing](doc:useAsyncListing) also provides the `accumulatePages` option
to make it easy to implement a UI where each page of results is appended to the
last (eg. infinite scroll).

```jsx {6}
const { result, isLoading, error } = useAsyncListing({
    trigger: 'SHALLOW',
    execute: getUsers,
    paginator,
    query: { keywords },
    accumulatePages: true,
});
```

The first time it's called it will return:

```json
[
    { "id": 1, "name": "Bilbo" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Frodo" }
]
```

If we call `paginator.next()` the result will be appended resulting in:

```json {4-5}
[
    { "id": 1, "name": "Bilbo" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Frodo" },
    { "id": 3, "name": "Gandalf" },
    { "id": 4, "name": "Samwise" }
]
```

It will only accumulate results if a subsequent call has all the same parameters _apart_
from the page which must be the next page. If this isn't the case then the accumulated
data will be reset. For example uf we then call `paginator.first()` it will reset the state:

```json
[
    { "id": 1, "name": "Bilbo" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Frodo" }
]
```
